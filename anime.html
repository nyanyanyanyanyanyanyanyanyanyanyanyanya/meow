    <mark>Pokémon XY and XY&Z</mark> started airing in 2013, making the series over ten years old now. Naturally, it's the first time Professor Sycamore appeared in the Pokémon anime, as early as second episode! From XY002 to XY145, he appears in 43 episodes, and makes a cameo in Pokémon Journeys, bringing the total amount of episodes he appears in to be 44. While the Professor Sycamore that appears in the anime is an accurate and respectful portrayal of his ingame self's personality, there are many major differences between the depictions that make them very different. That being said, I do love the character that is Professor Sycamore in the anime, even if it's not accurate all the time to his canon story in the games.

    <summary>XY002: Lumiose City Pursuit!<br>(メガシンカとプリズムタワー!)</summary>
    <div class="episode-review">
      <p>
        I think Lumiose City Pursuit is an amazing introduction to the XY series, it's face-paced, well animated, and interesting start to finish. It goes into a lot of details about characters that will become mainstays in the series going forward. Professor Sycamore makes his frist appearance here, where he introduces his lab, Garchomp, Froakie, and the concepts of mega evolution. He's shown to be a kind, empathetic, intelligent man who is proactive. This sis a great episode and a great introduction to Sycamore. This episode also shows how tall he is in the anime, he's practically a foot taller than other adult characters, like Officer Jenny! The voice acting(I watched it dubbed) is great, too. All in all a great episode!<br>🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

    <summary>XY003: A Battle of Aerial Mobility!<br>(ケロマツVSヤヤコマ! 空中機動バトル!!)</summary>
    <div class="episode-review">
      <p>
        In this episode, Ash joins the Kalos Pokémon League officially and catches Fletchling. Professor Sycamore makes an appearance when Serena arrives at his lab at the end of the episode. His lab is still in shambles after the last episode's Garchomp incident! He tells Serena about what happened last episode and offers her a starter Pokémon so she can become a trainer of her own. However, we don't know what she chooses yet until the next epsiode! This is a great episode even if Professor Sycamore only makes a small appearance. Ash's understanding of Froakie and his new friendship with Fletchling is fun to see, and setting up Dedenne's later appearances is done well, too! The battle choreography really makes the fights look awesome.
        🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<br>

    <summary>XY004: A Shockingly Cheeky Friendship!<br>(ピカチュウとデデンネ! ほっぺすりすり!!)</summary>
    <div class="episode-review">
      <p>
        Professor Sycamore appears at the very start of this episode, where he teaches Serena how to use her new Pokedex. She chooses her first starter: Fennekin! That's not the only new friendship formed this episode. This episode primarily focuses on Dedenne and how he ends up joining Ash and his friends on his journey. There's the usual appearance from Team Rocket, who were very mean, and even tried to hurt Dedenne. We see Fletchling and Bunnelby, and have a bunch of cute scenes. Bonnie is my favorite of Ash and his friends, so seeing her get Dedenne in the end, and how well she cares for Pokemon, is so sweet. Dedenne is also one of my favorite Pikachu clones, and he has so much big personality. He's a great fit with Bonnie! I also love how Clemont catches Dedenne for her, it helps you remember that she's young compared to Ash and Clemont, and Clemont is a good big brother. The episode ends with Serena all by herself in the woods, and she's heading to the Pokemon Center!

      <p>
          Ash is back for a rematch against Gym Leader Viola of Santalune City! Viola and her sister Alexa are Professor Sycamore's friends, and Ash is training hard with Alexa and her Noivern, getting Pikachu and Fletchling pumped up to fight Viola's surskit and vivillon. Clemont shows off a crazy new invention to mimic sticky webs, but after it bbreaks, Froakie instead helps with his frubbles. Serena drops a bombshell: she went to Professor Oak's Kano summer camp with Ash. She's uncertain about her future, too... Ash manages to snag the Bug Badge after an epic fight, and then it's off to Cyllage City! Sycamore? He's just mentioned by Bonnie because Froakie and Fennekin are from his lab... no screen time!
          <br> <br>
          This episode is great, with a fun battle sequence, smart training, and Serena's support. Pikachu's grit is so amazing!<br><br>

    <summary>XY010: Mega-Mega Meowth Madness!<br>(ハリマロンVSメガメガニャース！！)</summary>
    <div class="episode-review">
      <p>
 This episode is insane! The gang is back in Lumiose City, and Serena has a great idea to visit the professor while they're in the area! She's baked macarons(Yummy!) but the Chespin at the lab is so greedy! He eats them all and even pinches Clemont who tries to take them back. Meanwhile, Team Rocket is planning an evil scheme to steal the mega evolution data that Professor Sycamore has. They're going to use it to make a mega-mega meowth to catch Pikachu and take over the world. They crash a truck into Sycamore's lab, nab him, Serena, Bonnie, and even Dedenne... Sycamore gives up the mega evolution data in his pocket to protect the chilren. Team Rocket powers up their mega mega meowth machine and it's terrifying!
   <br> <br>
 Pikachu and Chespin try to fight it, but it's just too strong! That's when Mega Blaziken and Blaziken mask swoop in and flamethrower the machine to bits, proving machines can't hold a candle to real mega evolution. Sycamore and the gang are saved, and by the end of the episode, he encourages Clemont to officially take Chespin on as part of his team. This episode is peak POKÉMON XY!! Team Rocket's evil plan is wild and they're treated competently, the machine is very charming in design, and the Chespin-Clemont moment in the end is very adorable.  Chespin is a great addition to the party!
   <br> <br>
 This is avery Sycamore heavy episode! He's kidnapped, he's protecting the kids, he's geeking out over Team Rocket's machine. Amazing episode, especially for Sycamore fans!

    <summary>XY022: Pokémon: Mega Evolution Special<br>(ポケットモンスターXY特別編 最強メガシンカ ~Act I~)</summary>
    <div class="episode-review">
      <p>
The mega evolution special! The mega evolution specials are separated into four acts, and this is the first one. These episodes don't follow Ash and his friends, they follow a trainer named Alain instead. When the episode starts we're given a narration about mega evolution, which at this point, is still a very mysterious phenonemom being researched. We meet Alain who is battling an absol trainer, and both of their Pokemon mega evolve! It's so cool!</p><br>

  <p>A new trainer who just started her journey overhears the battle, her name is Mairin, and she spies on the battle just in time to see both of their mega evolutions. Alain wins the fight, and when Mairin approaches, we learn a little about Alain. We learn that he's actually a former research assistant of Professor Sycamore's! We flash back to when Alain was still an assistant and Charizard was just a charmander, and he has a conversation with Professor Sycamore that ultimately results in him asking if he can go on a journey with charmander. </p><br>
  <p>The nature of their conversation is important, it's about Professor Sycamore explaining what they know about mega evolution and how it works to their knowledge. He confirms a lot of little things about mega evolution, such as the power coming from the Pokemon, that a human is necessary to draw out the power of the bond, and speculation about the changing types/abilities happens during battle. He explains that mega evolution is such a big topic of his research because it, to his knowledge, only happens in Kalos so it's a giant topic of conversation when talking about Pokemon in general. It's Alain who suggests leaving and finding more samples - mega stones - to aid Professor Sycamore's research, and Sycamore encourages this, so long as Alain reports back to him.</p><br>
  <p>The episode continues with a few more battles, Alain finding a new mega stone, and Mairin catching a Flabebe. It ends on Alain's loss to Siebold of the Elite 4. </p><br>

  <p>The mega evolution specials are very polarizing, I think. They rely on the viewer to like Alain, and Alain himself is a controversial character, both in the context of Professor Sycamore and in the anime fandom as a whole. At this point, if it's not already obvious, Professor Sycamore's story, characterization, themes, ect have been changed a lot from the games, and Alain is a new addition to this. Elements such as Dexio, Sina, charizard, or even his friendship with Lysandre, have been removed and retrofitted into Alain instead. </p><br>

  <p>I, personally, enjoy Alain, Mairin, ect for what they are. I enjoy Professor Sycamore as he's depicted but I do understand it's very different from what he was. I definitely do understand the disappointment fans of the games might feel though, given that yes, his story, characterization, themes, ect are all massively changed. On some level, it can appear as tone deaf to what he originally represented, and XY's story as a whole. I also think that in terms of adaptation, Sycamore and XY could do a lot worse... the anime's track record is a bit suspicious sometimes...</p><br>

  <p>I'm getting a little offtopic! The battle animations are fine, and the battles were fun. Seeing Siebold was great, I really liked how Alain requested a special meal while sitting at the table like it were some secret exchange. We are really shown how mysterious mega evolution is, and when Alain remembers his conversations with Professor Sycamore, Professor Sycamore is depicted very kindly... Alain, who is quiet and distant, is shown in a different light in those flashbacks. You get the sense of how much the professor means to him, and how he keeps that to himself. </p><br>

  <p>Much of the first act is spent introducing characters, concepts, and battling, but overall, this is a good start! </p><br>

    <summary>XY028: The Bonds of Evolution!<br>(チャンピオン・カルネ登場！霧の中のメガサーナイト！！)</summary>
    <div class="episode-review">
      <p>
<i>Bonds of Evolution</i>marks Professor Sycamore's first appearance in the anime since episode 10, if you don't include his flashback in the Pokémon: Mega Evolution Special. This is also the first episode that the champion Diantha makes her appearance in the anime. Diantha is a favorite of mine and I find that this is an amazing introduction to her as a character. Ash and his friends are going to an exhibition match she's participating in, where they learn that she's not just the champion but also an accomplished actress. They meet Professor Sycamore who's there on business on his own. We find that he's a good "inside guy" to be able to meet the champion directly!</p>
  <p>The episode is primarily about Diantha's relationship with Gardevoir, showing how much a bond matters between the trainer and their Pokemon, and displaying what a champion-level bond looks like. Diantha and her Gardevoir are so effortlessly in tune with one another, their relationship is on another level!  Professor Sycamore's business actually has to do with Diantha's keystone... he'd like to borrow it for study, but she says no, because it's so important to her and Gardevoir. He tries to finesse his way into getting the keystone but is promptly told no! As he should be. Bonds are very important and intimate and he shouldn't just be so forward about intruding on them! </p>

  <p>That being said, several battles take place over the course of the episode, including a climax against Team Rocket who tries to abduct Gardevoir. We learn more about Diantha and Gardevoir's relationship. It's very sweet, and Professor Sycamore is given more context about how much connection matters with mega evolution. All in all, I think this is a great episode, especially with Diantha as the focus! She is so poised, confident, and beautiful, and her relationship with Gardevoir is displayed so nicely. It really puts forward the bonds and connection aspects of mega evolution.  </p>

  <p>I think Professor Sycamore is fine for this episode. We're shown more of his more mischevious side when we see him sneaking backstage to meet Diantha directly, and how he tries(and fails) to charm Diantha's assistant in order to smooth things over for keystone access. The XY games mentions his eccentricities and how he's a ladies' man and this episode tries to illustrate that.  </p>
