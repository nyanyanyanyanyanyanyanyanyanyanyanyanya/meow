      <mark>Professor Sycamore</mark> is described as a fashion-forward man. This aspect of his character helps reflect Lumiose' reputation as a center of style and culture. What better way than to drive home the impression of Lumiose than having the first person you meet be a chiq, trendy man, who exudes charm with every gesture? When he greets the player character with his happy gestures and coiffed hair, probably the trendiest professor released up until that point, the player instantly understands the kind of place they've arrived at, even if it's not directly stated. </p>

      However, during the course of the XY games, Professor Sycamore won't change his outfit. We do see his icon in the PSS, showing him without his labcoat, and we also see this look in official concept art of his character(pictured above). To find alternative outfits however, we'll need to dive into the world of extra media, such as the anime series. Let's look at some of those outfits now.<br>

    <h2>XY Anime</h2>
    <p>The first time we see Professor Sycamore without his labcoat is XY028, <i>The Bonds of Evolution!(チャンピオン・カルネ登場！霧の中のメガサーナイト！！)</i> in which we are introduced to Kalos Champion, Diantha, and more about mega evolution. I remember seeing Professor Sycamore with his iconic bag for the first time in XY&Z100, <i>A Giga Battle with Mega Results!(メガタブンネＶＳギガギガニャース！！) </i>, where we see him getting out of his vehicle.      </p>

    <p>It's implied that Professor Sycamore only wears his coat while in the laboratory, and when he's not directly hands on, he won't be wearing it. XY095 <i>Cloudy Fate, Bright Future! (カロスの危機！巨大日時計の戦い！！)</i>, an episode about Professor Sycamore going to research the sundial in Anistar City, will depict him in a labcoat. This tells me that this is a conscious decision of his. Given that the XY games also have this labcoat-free design and he often is seen outside of Lumiose, do you think he would've been shown in-game with his look had Gamefreak the opportunity to model it? Who knows, but it's fun to speculate!    </p>

      </figure>  <p>The XY and XY&Z animes show feature Professor Sycamore prominantely, including showing him without his labcoat, and an entirely new outfit we've never seen him before in. XY039, <i>Summer of Discovery!(ポケモン・サマーキャンプ！ライバル三人組登場！！)</i>, starts a four part series of episodes in which the protagonists enroll in Professor Sycamore's summer camp, battling and learning and making new friendships along the way. Professor Sycamore, our camp counselor, is ready to begin the week long event with a brand new outfit!
    </p>
    <p>Professor Sycamore just looks too adorable in his little outfit! His little hat, is my favorite part, it makes him look so cute! If you look carefully, you'll see that he's wearing open-back shoes of some kind, perhaps some kind of crocs brand? If somebody colordrops his shoes and his shirt he typically wears, taking into account some frame shading differences on the scene, the hex codes are the same!<br><br>

  <h2>Pokémon Masters EX</h2><center>
  <p>Professor Sycamore and Xerneas are a fairy-type sync pair in Pokémon Masters EX. Professor Sycamore was introduced into Masters initially in February 2021 with his original look, but in Janurary 2023, he was given the ability to be upgraded to 6EX. This allows trainers to unlock their EX Style! You can see this here:<br>
    <img src="https://south-boulevard.nekoweb.org/Images/ex.gif" width="300">  
  </p>
  <p>His colors have changed to reflect his bond with Xerneas. With the 3d rotation, you can see the stylish cut of his labcoat! I love his EX outfit, but would you have preferred different colors? <br><br>
    In December 2023, Professor Sycamore would also get a new unit in the form of a sync pair with Gogoat.<br>

    <figcaption><i>Professor Sycamore in his Holiday(2023) Outfit</i></figcaption>
  </p>
  <p>This is a special holiday themed outfit with special quotes for the holidays. It comes in two different variations, the original brown, and the EX version with the white. Both look so amazing and cool! If you look closely, you'll also see his hair has been slightly changed for this. In the provided in-game story, Shauna and Serena mention that they styled him themselves(and he wasn't planning on doing his hair)! I think it's so cute that he lets them style him for the holiday. I hope to see new outfits for Professor Sycamore from Masters EX soon, since now it's 2025, so it's been years at this point!<br>

  </p>
  <p>His Holiday 2023 outfit is appropriately festive, especially the 6EX variation. The outfit is playful, dapper, and seasonally appropriate! The bold colors are especially a major statement maker! It pushes the outfit from practical everyday to holiday celebration. The browns of the original color are nice in their own way too, matching with his sync partner, Gogoat. His trousers are more of a slim fit with a single pleat. Pleats are very old school menswear, but the slim fit(even slimmer than his normal trousers) is so modern! This makes a very contemporary look for him, I think. Overall, I enjoy this outfit, and the story associated with it.</p>
