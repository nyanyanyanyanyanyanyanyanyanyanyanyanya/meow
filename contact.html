    Hello! I am always interested in connecting with fellow fans of Pokémon, Pokémon XY, Kalos, and Professor Sycamore. If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, etc, please don't hesitate to get into contact with me. I have multiple channels available. You can leave a comment in the <a href="https://profsycamore.atabook.org/" target="_blank">guestbook</a> or the chatbox, or if you'd prefer personal correspondence, you can email me by clicking Professor Sycamore. If you'd like me to link to your site, be sure to mention your website/blog/etc, so I can properly link to you. Thank you.<br><br>
For your consideration, I also have these aveneus open:<br>
