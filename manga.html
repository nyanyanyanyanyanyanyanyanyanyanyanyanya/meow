      <mark>Pokémon Adventures</mark>, or Pokespe (ポケスペ / ポケSP), is a Japanese manga written by Hidenori Kusaka and currently illustrated by Satoshi Yamamoto. X&amp;Y is the twelfth chapter in the manga, and is based on the XY games. While many of the characters and situations resemble their game iterations, they often don't 1:1 recreate the games, so are self-contained to their own continuity. The X&amp;Y chapters are after the Emerald chapter, around the time of ORAS. Professor Sycamore, as a prominent character in XY, makes a sizable appearance in the manga, in which his personality and appearance are faithfully recreated. While his actions and general storyline differ from his game counterpart, I still feel like manga Professor Sycamore is an enjoyable and respectable portrayal of him!

      <summary>X&amp;Y001: An X-cuse to Come Out and Play (ガルーラ、待つ, Kangaskhan, Wait?)</summary>
      <div class="chapter-review">
        Professor Sycamore makes a minor appearance, and his first appearance, in this chapter in the form of a call to Trevor, who is running an errand on his behalf. It's short but cute establishing Trevor doing things for the professor! The delivery in question is actually a shipment of Kalos starters, including Fennekin, Chespin, and Froakie. Trevor is there to deliver the starts to X(Calem in the games) because X has become a shut in. However, things in Vanivelle take a turn nobody could expect...<br>

      <div class="chapter-review">
        The next time we see Professor Sycamore is when Trevor brings him up when speaking to the other Kalos friends. They're at an inn in Aquacorde Town after a terrible incident happened in Vanivelle, but before they could get into any details, they're being ambushed by the nefarious Team Flare.<br>

      <div class="chapter-review">
        This chapter is the first time we see the professor outside of calls or references. He receives a panicked recording from Trevor who was there at the time of the Vanivelle incident, and he discusses the importance of the recorded legendary Pokémon and figuring out the truth of what happened in Vanivelle Town, and how important it was at the time that the boy was able to record the incident. The recording was actually taken with a Holocaster, which is the invention of Mr.Lysandre - the same Mr.Lysandre that Professor Sycamore is talking to in this chapter! It ends on a cliffhanger...<br>

        This chapter continues right where the previous chapter leaves off, with Professor Sycamore and Mr.Lysandre talking about the recorded footage, and coming to the conclusion that those indeed are the legendary Pokemon of myth based on the provided footage. It's also revealed that Lysandre and Professor Sycamore are friends and/or colleagues, with Lysandre supporting the lab with his funding in exchange for Professsor Sycamore providing information on his research. Hmm... well, the two seem to be good friends! <br>

        This chapter is when Professor Sycamore finally meets the Kalos friend group in person.

However, after everything the friends have been through at this point, X doesn't trust Professor Sycamore at all. Professor Syamore attempts to bridge the communication gap via a Pokémon battle while he sends the Kalos friends to get their Holocaster devices repaired by Lysandre at his cafe. <br>

      <div class="chapter-review">
        X, whose heart wasn't very much in the battle, treats the affair flippantly and lets Chespin get battered. Professor Sycamore offers an opportunity for X to throw the battle but Chespin shows an incredible amount of fortitude when he won't back down. This inspires X to finally start issuing commands even if he didn't quite care for Professor Sycamore's methodology. After the battle's end, X also requests to take Charmander, but provides no explanation as to why. The two leave the lab together, sensing danger! <br>
