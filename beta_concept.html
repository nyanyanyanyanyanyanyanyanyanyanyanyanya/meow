    <h3>Beta Information</h3>
    <p>
      During the 2024 Gamefreak leaks, there was a lot of inside information brought to light, particularly around character concepts, regional concepts, and so on. Not just in the sense of concept art, but many biographies were unearthed of what appears to be initial directions for characters. Most popular of those are trainers like Skyla, of course! But many prominent and less-than-prominent trainers have their basics outlined, including Professor Sycamore.

    <h3>Original Translation from 4chan</h3>
    <p>
      ■ Doctor Setting<br>
      ● Base Keywords<br>
      The doctor is a man (French, from Paris). 35 years old, full of passion. Not serious, but surprisingly careless. He has a loud voice and talks a lot. He has a producer-like feel. He studies evolution with many assistants at the research lab. He also teaches at school as a professor. He is particular about beauty, of course. He is particular about what he wears, and about what he eats. He is particular about everything from the shape of Pokemon to the beauty of Pokemon's moves. He studies evolution under the belief that if it is not beautiful, it is not true. "Let's find out about this!" "You'll understand if you try it, won't you?" The hidden theme and keyword is "Napoleon".<br>
      ● Name: Sycamore<br>
      ● Appearance/Clothing Image<br>
      The concept is casual but stylish clothing. A brightly colored shirt under the lab coat. A stole or scarf around the neck. Jeans on the bottom, but loafers on the feet. Accessories on the arms and neck. Overall slim silhouette.<br>
      ●Appearance/Personal Image<br>
      When he's not wearing his white coat, he has the image of a stylish, cheerful, gentle man. Caucasian of Italian descent. Memorable, strong but sweet features. (Scruffy) Beard. Black, permed hair. Blue-gray eyes. Modeled after Serge Gainsbourg.<br>
      ●Inner self/personality traits<br>
      The basics are based on the blue text (base image). He speaks with large gestures. He is passionate about research and the idea of beauty. On the other hand, he is loose with time and has a generous, careless, and careless side.<br>
      ●Inner self/hobbies and things he is good at<br>
      Cafe hopping. If the doctor shows him around, he will take you to a delicious restaurant with a star rating. He also enjoys photography, and his own work is exhibited in an art museum, but his skills are inferior to Friend A's.<br>
      ●Inner self/things he is not good at<br>
      Women. Unlike Friend C, he is easygoing and loves women too much, which leads to his own downfall. He tries to woo his assistant, but is rejected and depressed. He is basically not good at sports. He can't ride a bicycle or roller skates. No matter how many times he tries, he always falls over. He secretly gets Friend C to train him.
    </p><br><br>
    <p>
      This is the original translation that unearthed from 4chan in 2024, included for completion's sake, but also because it has additional information not in the page: it includes his hobbies, including the fact that his photography is in a museum! Tihs would later become a thing brought up in Masters EX, so it's very fun to see it here. I find it very funny that he's 'not good with women' because he loves too much... of course! We can also see a little snippet we haven't seen before that Friend C trains him to not be terrible at rollerskating. That's so cute! Who are friends A, C, ect? Well, gauging by the bios below, they seem to be the various friends in the Kalos friendgroup.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      I am quite fond of the way that they describe Professor Sycamore in the beta material! I believe that the XY games accurately capture the depiction they were hoping to get across. Professor Sycamore, despite having no voice acting, has a very loud and passionate presence behind him. His exaggerated movements are depicted in-game with the (at the time) new 3d models and cutscenes. He's always got a bit of flourish to him! This also provides a little insight to things going on behind the scenes of his character, particularly his affinity for beauty but his philosophy around it. He's fond of beautiful things but sees the importance of things that are less so, making him a balanced individual. His passion is definitely inspiring to people around him. The producer-like persona is a very fitting description for him, though this might be one of the only times I've seen a producer-like character be shown in a positive light!
    </p><br>
    <p>
      All in all, I adore how the beta information shows the groundwork for what would eventually become Professor Sycamore. Oh! By the way, if you're not sure who Serge Gainsbough is, he was an extremely popular French artist, producer, ect. He was known for his eccentricies and the way his art might have rubbed people the wrong way, so citing him as an inspiration for Professor Sycamore is very cool! 
    </p><br>
        <p>
    The 4chan translation mentions that he's not very good with women because he loves too much. I think this implies that Professor Sycamore is a bit of a flirt, spreading affections across multiple women. It's a very classical interpetation, a romantic man who can't settle on one. This aligns with his personality and the fact he's inspired by Serge Gainsbourgh, a man known for numonrous romantic entanglements! He's described as careless, so he might end up being a charming but unreliable romantic, defeated by his scattered affections and head. Additionally, with his  loud voice, large gestures, and passionate nature, romantic gestures would probably be very dramatic! Something like that might feel inauthentic or even smothering, leading to rejection and his subsequent depreression. He is easygoing but unable to temper his enthusiasm, either by pursuing too many women or being too dramatic with one, which leads to romantic stumbling. The fact he gets depressed after rejection implies to me that he's genuine in his investment, not just a shallow flirt, but his feelings backfire! His enthusiasm for love outpaces his ability to navigate it ...

      This is, of course, Shauna! From this, we can probably assume that A is the rival, B is Shauna, but who are C and D? I'mthinking C is Tierno! Additionally, while not directly relates to Professor Sycamore, I thought it would be fun to include this:
