          <p>This will be where I put his themes! Please bear with me while I figure out how to host them!</p>

          </div>
          <p>The above is his main theme that plays when you encounter him over the course of the game! When this plays, you always know he's on screen! The player first hears this song after arriving at his lab. Because of how XY is set up, this means the player will always have at least 1 gym badge before meeting the professor of the game! Weird, right?! It feels like a very classical sort of song, I think...</p>

          </div>
          <p>Likewise, this is also his encounter theme, but as played by the Melbourne Pops Orchestra. This is from the Pokémon Symphonic Evolutions Concert at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, Nov. 13th, 2015. I think it's amazing to hear his theme orchestrated by a big band! It really comes across as boisterous, with much personality. It is a song that loudly exclaims, 'I'm here!', when walking into the room!</p>

          </div>
          <p>This little jingle is what plays in his lab. It really gives a lighthearted, scholarly feel! Don't you think? If you listen closely, it's similar to Welcome to Kalos, listed below!</p>

          </div>
          <p>This is the song that first plays when the player begins a new game. Sycamore, like all professors, introduces what Pokémon are and asks a little bit about the player character before the game begins! Welcome to Kalos ... it's very fitting!</p>

          </div>
                    <p>This song is actually from Pokémon Masters EX, it's normal theme remixed! It sounds so cool and high energy! </p>

          <p>This is the song that plays in Anistar City, which is where the mysterious sundial is that Professor Sycamore is researching. </p>

          <p>No list of Sycamore-related music is complete without the theme from Lumiose City, the place he lives, loves, and works in! </p>
