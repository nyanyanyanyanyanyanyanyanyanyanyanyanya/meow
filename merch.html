Much of his merchandise [almost all] necessitates importing from Japan or is already out of production, so some of it can be difficult to obtain, pricy, or both. I really wish the availability was better, but that's just not how things are, I suppose! This section isn't for TCG talk, it's only for other merchandise. Let's start off with one of the more popular items:</p>

            <p>This is the Pokémon Center Original Mascot, Pokémon Trainers Professor Sycamore keychain plushie! Isn't he adorable? This released in 2022 and was only sold in Japan Pokémon centers, for a limited time and limited quantity. It comes with a little chain. It's about 16CM tall and made from polyester. This item is usually still available if you look, and it's the thing to have for any Professor Sycamore fan! He's small enough that he can travel with you all over, go on fun adventures, or you could even make little outfits for him. The reveal of these keychain plushies coincided with his Lodge debut in Pokémon Masters EX, so it was an especially exciting time to be a Sycamore fan in 2022. <br><br> When the Pokémon lodge debuted, it also came with an assorted set of merchandise of the initial run of characters, including playmats, pocket binders, deck cases, mugs, binders, etc. Each character featured received an acrylic stand release with both the character and their partner Pokémon. In Sycamore's case, that's Xerneas! In addition to the stand, it's also a keychain, so you'll be able to put Professor Sycamore on your phone, bag, or keys, too. But I like his little stand, it's pink for fairy-typing. All of the Pokémon lodge merchandise (playmats, deck cases, etc.) all share the same design.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center;">The things below are very rare! They were released in Japan in 2014. Serena, Calem, and Professor Sycamore got a lineup of merchandise. Sycamore received exclusive art of himself at a cafe with Chespin! Finding images of these things are difficult, I'm sorry for the varying quality.</p>

          <p>If you notice, one of the things above isn't a little merchandise! It's actually a full-size standee of Professor Sycamore. Look closely at the lower right, you'll see a chair there, so you can take a picture with yourself, the professor, and Chespin! This merchandise is so cool. If you look closely at the design of it, you'll see that he's sitting in a red cafe with assorted tiles. Familiar, maybe?</p>
