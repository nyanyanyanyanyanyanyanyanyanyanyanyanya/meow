      This list provides a lot of insight into the things Professor Sycamore enjoys. Combining certain topics allows you to draw conclusions. For example, he likes exercise and forests, so maybe he enjoys hiking. He likes reading and ruins, so perhaps he’s into reading about myths. Of course, his most favored topics are his friends, showing how much he values connection, but that's just my perspective!
