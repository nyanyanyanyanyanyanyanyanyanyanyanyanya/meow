      <mark>Pokémon Masters EX</mark> is a free game available on mobile/iOS. It's a gacha game featuring many trainers and side stories, including Professor Sycamore. Professor Sycamore in Pokémon Masters EX is based on the game's continuity. While its stories and events aren't necessarily canon to the main games, the developers have indicated in an interview that the characters' behaviors are consistent. This makes the game a great way to explore more of Professor Sycamore's character!

      The Trainer Lodge is a key feature added a few years ago. You interact with various sync pairs (characters and their partner Pokémon) in a cozy lodge, unlocking new side stories as you increase your friendship level with them. It's gamified, with items you can purchase to boost your performance in the gameplay mode. This isn't a guide for that—there are better resources elsewhere—but rather a look at the conversational topics that interest Professor Sycamore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each sync pair has a daily hot topic, and you can choose various subjects to discuss. Topics that align with the sync pair's interests hold their attention longer.

      I think this list provides a lot of insight into the things he enjoys. Combining certain topics allows you to draw conclusions. For example, he likes exercise and forests, so maybe he enjoys hiking. He likes reading and ruins, so perhaps he’s into reading about myths. Of course, his most favored topics are his friends, showing how much he values connection but that's just my perspective!
