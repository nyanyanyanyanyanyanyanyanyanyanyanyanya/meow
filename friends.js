One can reasonably assume that the two have worked together in the past, given they live close by and their respective careers. Those being Alexa as a journalist and Professor Sycamore as a researcher. The anime goes further in showing them interact. It should be noted that she's also Viola's sister. See the Viola section for more information about Viola.",
                name: "Alexa in XY refers to Professor Syamore as 'Augustine', which implies some degree of familiarity, as that's his first name instead of his title.  ",
                info: "She is a reporter in Lumiose and they are bound to run into each other occasionally: in the XY games, she stops the player character, asking if they're one of the children the professor is talking about. This means that the professor has been telling everybody about these kids he's so impressed with! In the anime and manga, her role is expanded, where she's more of a supporting mentor than just an NPC. In the manga they share a distant professional kind of relationship, as Professor Sycamore doesn't seem to know her, but in the anime, they're much more friendly. They even have an episode together featuring the two of them together.",

                info: "Calem is one of the children that Professor Sycamore sends on a journey at the start of XY. Depending on the player's choice, he will either be the playable character or the rival. As the rival, I feel like the context of his relationship with the Professor changes a little.  Rival Calem is characterized to be a very promising trainer from Vanivelle Town who doesn't like losing, so it's easy to think how surprised he'd be when suddenly he's upstaged by a neighbor who just moved in, that was suddenly chosen to go on the same journey he was chosen to go on. Either way, he helps the professor, with his goal being to get stronger, and he's the other child who's very interested in mega evolution(the first being the player character). Calem unfortunately doesn't exist in the anime, though Ash does wear an outfit inspired by him. Calem in the manga is named X, a gifted child who peaked in his batling skills early, and the social pressures of becoming famous at a young age resulted with him becoming a shut in. He doesn't meet Professor Sycamore until later, but the two share an uneasy bond.",

                journey: "Calem follows a journey very similiar to the player character because they both disembark from Vanivelle Town together. It presumably follows a similiar route as the player character all the way to the end of the game. He knows of Professor Sycamore before arriving in Lumiose City and meets himat the same time the rest of the Kalos friends do."
