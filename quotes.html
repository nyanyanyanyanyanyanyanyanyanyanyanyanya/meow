    <script>const quotes=["Welcome to the world of Pokémon!","I am Augustine Sycamore, the Kalos region's very own Pokémon Professor.","This world of ours is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon!","These mysterious creatures can be found in every corner of our world...","Some run across the plains, others fly through the skies, and others yet swim in deep oceans...","We live together with these Pokémon, lending our strength to one another to live and prosper.","Let's get started with some quick questions... Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?","And what do you look like?","Oho, I see. Would you tell me your name?","So it's <player>, then? Did I get that right?","<player>... Très bien! What a fantastic name!","<player>! Your adventure begins now! You are about to enter the beautiful Kalos region!","Go and meet many Pokémon and people, and fill your life with rich experiences!","Now let's go visit the world of Pokémon!","So, we finally meet!","Fantastic! You're here! Come this way, won't you?","Many thanks for coming all the way from Vaniville Town! I'm Professor Sycamore! It's a pleasure to finally meet you! How is your Pokémon journey going so far? Have you met many different Pokémon? Fantastic! Let me have a quick look at your Pokédex and see!","Well now, you DO have a certain je ne sais quoi! I have a good feeling about you! At first, I was thinking of choosing only one child from a town when I was deciding who to give a Pokémon to. In Vaniville Town, it was going to be the child of a Veteran Trainer I know. About then, I learned that the Rhyhorn racer Grace and her son/daughter were moving here. Here in the Kalos region, you're far away from everything you used to know... That really hit me right here... Then it hit me--I should give you a Pokémon and have you travel around Kalos!","Fantastic! Now, let's all have a Pokémon battle! Your opponent shall be me!","Shall we start the battle?","Just so you know, I'm not that tough!","No problem at all! I'll wait! I'll wait as long as I must!","Ha ha! You're too much for me! You're really something, aren't you?","I think I've about figured it out!","<Player>! You are an interesting Pokémon Trainer indeed! It'd be fantastic if you took another Pokémon with you! Here! Pick one!","You picked Bulbasaur/Charmander/Squirtle, then! I see. That's simply wonderful!","Oh! So you don't want it right now? Come back and get your Pokémon once you've organized your PC Boxes.","Would you like to give your Pokémon a nickname?","So, you've decided its nickname will be <nickname>?","Oh, I see. You're not going to give your Pokémon a nickname, then.","Since you chose Bulbasaur/Charmander/Squirtle, I'll give you this Mega Stone.","Come now, you two. Pick your Pokémon.","Well, I've got a feeling everyone else will show up soon.","See. Wonderful! Everyone's all here! So now that we're all here, I'd like to say a few words. Be the best Trainer you can be! At the same time, remember to have fun traveling with your Pokémon! Also, I want to ask for your help in solving the Kalos region's biggest Pokémon mystery: the secret and potential of Mega Evolution, a new kind of Evolution that occurs in battle! That's why I gave you that Mega Stone just now. It's an important clue!","Trevor, my lad, if that's what best Trainer means to you, then I want you to go out there and complete that Pokédex!","If you're investigating Mega Evolution, why don't you check out Camphrier Town? That town has a lot of history--you might find a hint there! Now listen. If you visit many different places to complete the Pokédex, you will probably see Pokémon with many ways of living and meet people with many ways of thinking. First, accept the ways of living and thinking that sometimes conflict with your own. And think about what's really imporant--this will truly broaden your horizons.","Why hello! Nice to see you! Here's the <Pokémon> you chose! Take good care of it, OK?","Congratulations! I see you finally obtained everything you need for Mega Evolution! A Mega Stone for the Pokémon, a Mega Ring for the Trainer, and a strong bond with your Pokémon.","It's only a hypothesis, but I think the bond between Pokémon and Trainer is the key to this new Evolution. But what is this bond, exactly? And why are there examples of Mega Evolution only in the Kalos region? There's still so much we don't know...","Oh! What an excellent point! Indeed! The more you know, the more there is to research! The excitement never ends, does it?","Oh, that's right! I came here to give you this!","Use the HM Fly to pop right over to Pokémon Centers of places you've already visited! Well then, <player>...","Diantha, I hope to see you both again soon!","Over here!","I was just having a conversation with Lysandre about Mega Evolution.","Actually, Lysandre himself is of royal ancestry... He truly is a chosen one.","By the way, <player>... Do you know where the Holo Caster is made?","That's right! They're made in Lysandre's lab.","Oh really? Well, they just happen to be made in Lysandre's lab.","Lysandre is a great man. He supports Trainers and Pokémon research with some of the profit from the Holo Caster.","What a passionate person. He's just like a blazing flame. Perhaps his pride in his lineage is what makes him burn so intensely.","That being said, what Lysandre says is only one way of looking at things... It's not necessarily the truth. <player>! What's truly important is the time you spend together with others! Treasure these moments spent traveling the Kalos region with your Pokémon!","Hello...","I have to apologize to you about Lysandre... I'm very sorry for the trouble he caused...","And I'd also like to thank you! I'm sincerely grateful for what you did for all of the Pokémon and people of this world. And by stopping Team Flare, you also saved Lysandre. I always knew that he desired a beautiful world...","And maybe someday the population of people and Pokémon will actually increase to where resources become very scarce. If someone acts out of greed in such a world, surely some will go without. If all living things keep acting that way, there will be nothing left at all in the end. Why, there won't even be anything left to steal, will there?","But what I really wanted was for him to put his ego aside and lead everything to greater heights. I never had this discussion with him, though. So I'm partially responsible for this.","Well, enough of that. <player>! I want you and your Pokémon to take everything you learned from your journey and hit me with your very best shot!","You are really something! You and your Pokémon have developed strong bonds by spending time together and by caring about one another. That's why you and your Pokémon are so strong.","The strength you've found is simply marvelous! And... You truly love and trust your Pokémon! <player>! A treasure of mine is hidden in this town! If you'd like, try to find it. Well, I'll be off then! I have many preparations I must attend to! I have a little surprise planned for all of you to thank you for fighting Team Flare and saving Kalos!","What an amazing turnout! All of these people are here to celebrate your achievements. I'd like to present you with the Honor of Kalos for the bravery you showed battling Team Flare! I'm so proud of you all! On behalf of the entire Kalos region, I'd like to say... Thank you!","His Pokémon was waiting all this time... Waiting for him to return to the man who loved Pokémon with all his heart.","How did you like your parade, <player>? So the reason I asked you to come here is... I wanted to give you a pass to Kiloude City!","Doesn't ring any bells? Kiloude City is a city in the southern part of the Kalos region. And it's the perfect place for Trainers looking to sharpen their skills! So here's your pass for the super high-speed rail to Kiloude City!","Use it to ride the TMV super high-speed rail! Take your pass to that scanner over there. It's an orange machine. Have the machine scan your pass to board the train. Have a fantastic time!","Why, hello, <player>!","Running around all over Kalos is actually rather tiring, is it not?","Oh yeah, I'm the one making you do that, aren't I?","Terribly sorry about that!","Well, Calem/Serena may have already told you, but I found a way to power up the Mega Ring!","Before we get to that, however...","Let's talk about Mega Stones briefly.","My theory is that they're special stones irradiated by the light--the energy of the Legendary Pokemon YveltalY/XerneasX--fired from the ultimate weapon 3,000 years ago.","And that's what I think they are.","It's even possible that stones like Fire Stones were what turned into these Mega Stones.","So, what's the Mega Ring you are holding?","That mysterious stone transforms feelings felt towards Pokemon into some kind of wavelength.","The Mega Ring works in a similar way to how this object over here works.","It's an object that changes sunlight into a mysterious light.","For one hour starting at 8 pm, this sundial starts emitting light.","This mysterious object has towered over the city here for over 3,000 years.","It's[sic] relationship to the Mega Ring isn't understood at all yet.","Now, let's get down to the heart of the matter!","<player>! Try touching the sundial!","You were exposed to the Legendary Pokemon's energy in Team Flare's secret HQ.","And the Mega Ring has absorbed the power of the sundial.","These two powers have combined to upgrade your Mega Ring.","Now, it will react to underground Mega Stones, but only when the sundial is emitting light.","I'm sure these stones hide in every corner of Kalos! Use this power to find them!","Well now, let's have a look at your Pokédex!","Your Pokédex must be jam-packed with all the memories of your journey... I hope you treasure it always!","You're encountering Pokémon at a really good clip, aren't you?","I have something for you, so stop by the lab when you have a moment!","You're encountering Pokémon at a really good clip, aren't you?","I want to give you this to help you reach your goal!","So, if you're holding an Oval Charm, Eggs are discovered at the Pokémon Day Care more easily than normal.","You're encountering Pokémon at a really good clip, aren't you?","I want to give you this to help you reach your goal!","Holding a Shiny Charm will improve your chances of finding a Shiny Pokémon!","Congratulations! You completed the Pokédex!","Hmm... So you've seen <number> kinds of Pokémon in Central Kalos, then.","You have to get yourself in that tall grass if you're going to find any Pokémon!","Oh ho! The pages are getting filled in. It's starting to look good!","Some Pokémon can be hard to find, but keep on searching in the tall grass!","Battling against other Trainers is another good way to fill up your Pokédex!","Some Pokémon only appear in certain places! Keep an eye out!","Why hello! Find any Pokémon that you've taken a particular shine to yet?","Just a little bit more, and you'll have found every kind of Pokémon in the Central Kalos area!","Congratulations! You've encountered every kind of Pokémon in the Central Kalos area!","Incredible! You've already completed the Central Kalos Pokédex!","Oh ho! You've seen <number> kinds of Pokémon in Coastal Kalos.","A new Pokédex means new Pokémon! How exciting!","I've heard that there are Trainers out there who have some truly rare Pokémon with them!","Some Pokémon can be found only by fishing. Aren't Pokémon fascinating?","Some Pokémon can only be seen inside caves!","Some Pokémon Abilities make it easier for you to encounter wild Pokémon!","You should try using Surf to explore new areas and find the Pokémon that live there!","Just a little bit more, and you'll have found every kind of Pokémon in the Coastal Kalos area!","Congratulations! You've encountered every kind of Pokémon in the Coastal Kalos area!","Incredible! You've already completed the Coastal Kalos Pokédex!","I see! You've seen <number> kinds of Pokémon in Mountain Kalos.","The third Pokédex of the Kalos region! I wonder what kinds of Pokémon you'll find!","It's so interesting to look at the differences between the Pokémon that live in each area!","I'll bet the Pokémon you can find in the mountains and caves are tough and rugged!","There are still many Pokémon awaiting you in locations you've yet to visit!","It's fascinating to learn how certain Pokémon evolve!","Isn't it great to learn about all of the different Pokémon that are out there?","Just a little bit more, and you'll have found every kind of Pokémon in the Mountain Kalos area!","Congratulations! You've encountered every kind of Pokémon in the Mountain Kalos area!","Incredible! You've already completed the Mountain Kalos Pokédex!","You've caught a total of <number> kinds of Pokémon! Fantastic! And you caught <number> of those Pokémon species in the Kalos region!","Keep traveling through the Kalos region, and you might find even more new encounters!","I hear there are more than 700 kinds of Pokémon to be found in the National Pokédex!","Now remember--the trick to catching a Pokémon is to lower its HP before using a Poké Ball!","Rumor has it that some Pokémon can only be encountered by hatching Eggs!","You won't be able to find all of the underwater Pokémon by fishing in just one spot!","The Sticky Hold and Suction Cups Abilities make Pokémon easier to reel in when fishing.","Pokémon with the Magnet Pull Ability can help you encounter Steel-type Pokémon more easily!","Pokémon with the Static Ability can help you encounter Electric-type Pokémon more easily!","Some Pokémon only evolve by becoming friendly with their Trainer!","Wow! You've caught 500 kinds of Pokémon! You sure are an amazing Trainer!","Some Pokémon can only evolve at certain times of day or in certain places!","There are some moves that leave Pokémon with just a tiny bit of HP left!","Some Pokémon have Abilities that prevent wild Pokémon from fleeing!","Wow, 600! Pokémon sure do live in all kinds of places!","You're a Pokémon-catching pro, you know that? My jaw drops at your incredible skills!","Trading Pokémon with friends is another great way to fill up your Pokédex!","If you have access, it might be a good idea to use the GTS, too!","Almost 700... Just a little bit more! Keep it up!","This is it! We're in the final countdown for your momentous completion of the National Pokédex!","Congratulations!","This is such an emotional moment! I'm so lucky to have met you! This Pokédex could not have been completed without the sweat and hard work you put in as a Pokémon Trainer... It's a one-of-a-kind treasure chest packed full of your dreams!","Incredible!
