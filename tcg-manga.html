     <h1>TCG Manga</h1>
     <p> For those that don't know, <mark>Let's Play the Pokémon Card Game</mark> is a manga based on the TCG.  ポケモンカードゲームＸＹ　ＢＲＥＡＫ　やろうぜ～っ！ Let's Play the Pokémon Card Game XY BREAK!, is the XY-based sequel! While Professor Sycamore does not appear in XY BREAK, a character that looks very similar to him does appear! His name is Hiroshi Uratane(ウラターヌ博士 ), and he is a Pokémon Card Game researcher who is researching the newest mechanic revealed at the time: mega evolution!  </p><br>
        <p> The artwork you see here is actually by the <a href="https://x.com/tyuutyuutarou/status/789079776392687616">mangaka,</a> Ryū Matsushima (Japanese: 松島リュウ) in 2016, so please check it out on their Twitter! I think this might be the only official illustration of Hiroshi Uratane in color. 
  </p><br>
         <p> Uratane Hiroshi also has a voice actor, since the entire TCG manga(I think) has its chapters voice-acted! They have not been dubbed to other languages, so he only has a Japanese voice actor.
  </p><br>
 <p><b>Japanese:</b> 宮本克哉 Katsuya Miyamoto</p><br>
 <p>Did you know that Katsuya Miyamoto is also credited for being a voice in <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>? Amazing!</p><br>
  <h3>ウラターヌ博士 Uratane Hiroshi, or, more about his name</h3> 
    <p> I am not fluent in Japanese or the etymology of Japanese names, so I will do my best to try and unpack his name. Please don't hesitate to let me know if my findings are inaccurate.</p><br>
<p>裏 (ura) means “back,” but it can also mean “secret,” “hidden,” or even “reverse.” 
  So one way to interpret it is Ura-tane, or Reverse-tan, kind of like a bizarro Sycamore!
  It’s also possible that Uratānu comes from 裏技 (urawaza), which means “secret trick” or “hidden technique,” like a clever workaround. I think that fit his role as a researcher into the new(at the time) mega evolution TCG mechanics!</p><br>
  <p>His name also sounds, phonetically, similar to Sycamore’s Japanese name, プラターヌ博士 (Platane-hakase). 
  Both end in ターヌ and have that same rhythm, so it feels intentional,  like he’s a mirror or parody of Professor Sycamore from other media.</p><br>
  <p>
   博士 usually means “professor” or “doctor” (hakase), but in this case it’s part of his name: Hiroshi. 
  So it’s kind of a fun twist! I think it's very cute!
