<center><h4>About South Boulevard</h4>
<p>
  <mark>As I build South Boulevard,</mark> I find myself seeing just Professor Sycamore is tied into the themes of Pokémon XY. To me, celebrating him is also celebrating Kalos, and the games themselves. Professor Sycamore is a big part of the experience, so enjoying one also means understanding the other. Very few characters in the series embody the themes of Pokémon XY as well as Professor Sycamore, which I think is no coincidence.</p>

 <p> South Boulevard, to me, isn't just a webshrine to Professor Sycamore...it's a love letter to Pokémon XY. They are games of such sincerity and heart that I can't help but love them.</p>

  <p>I value sincerity in expression above all else. Technical skill, final product, those matter far less to me than the ideas and feelings people want to share. The XY games, for all their technical flaws, are sincere. XY, Kalos... there's an authenticity to them. It's not exactly quantifiable. SOVL, if you will. Or, as Professor Sycamore himself might say: <i>A certain je ne sais quoi.</i></p>

  <p>I'm not very good at explaining things, unfortunately...</p>

  <p>This webshrine is a way of celebrating not just Professor Sycamore, but the sincerity of games that tried to make something special even when they couldn’t perfectly execute it. In a world where many things feel cynical, calculated, and checkmarked, there's something comforting about experiences that feel like they came from people who cared. There is something very lovely about XY, its themes of optimism, and love, and bonds, that resonates with me.</p>

  <p>That's what I see in Professor Sycamore, and in XY as a whole: an earnest attempt to express something genuine about connection and the value of the moment. He's very authentic. The games are very sincere. I think that's worth celebrating...even with all the imperfections. Or maybe especially because of them.</p>

  <p>It's kind of like Mega Evolution in a way... it's the bond that matters most, less so the end result.</p>
