    Professor Augustine Sycamore, like most professors in the series, is the first character the player character meets when starting a new game. However, unlike other professors, he's the first professor you do battle with—as well as the first professor to give you two starter Pokémon! The player character meets him several times over the course of their adventure in Pokémon XY. He serves as a mentor figure, encouraging the player character to visit many different places in Kalos, see how Pokémon live in different ways, and meet people with diverse perspectives. His advice: be open-minded and think deeply about what's truly important...

    And it would make him really happy if you completed the PokéDex, too...!

    Professor Sycamore specializes in the study of mega evolution. Prior to the release of Pokémon Sun & Moon (and the associated Rotom Dex entries), mega evolution is framed to be the ultimate bond between a trainer and their Pokémon—a powerful form unlocked by only the strongest emotional connections! Professor Sycamore's dedication to studying mega evolution reflects his understanding of the importance of empathy, trust, and love. To him, the depth of this connection is what brings incredible power! However, when it comes to achieving that power himself, Professor Sycamore isn't so confident.

    In Shalour City lies the Tower of Mastery, home of the Mega Evolution guru, Gurkinn. In the Tower of Mastery's halls, the history of mega evolution is kept. The legends say it all started with a single Lucario and their deep bond with a human. Despite all of this, Professor Sycamore abandons his mega evolution training in those halls. He didn't think he could do it... but he has unending optimism for others to achieve what he couldn't. Perhaps Professor Sycamore is right, he's not good enough. Or perhaps there's something deeper there...

    ...maybe he just doesn't think highly of himself?! Well, that's one interpretation, anyway! He might just be acting silly, which he can be, since he is often absentminded! Oh, and please take a look at his office in the picture above. Notice anything? That's right—he's got paintings and books all over the floor! Oh, careless professor, when will you handle those? If you keep looking, you'll also notice there's a gramophone on his table, or a turntable. He must be a bit of a music fan, an appreciator of oldies, maybe? What sort of things do you think he listens to? Whatever it is, personally, I think he seems like the type to enjoy shopping for records. The joy of discovering something new...

    I'm sure that's a feeling Professor Sycamore cherishes!
