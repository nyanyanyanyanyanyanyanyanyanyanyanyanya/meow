                While Professor Sycamore's relationship to mega evolution is not only well-documented (and highly promoted, it's his forte), I believe that with careful examination of his journey throughout Kalos, we see a new side of his character. That side being, his connection to trains!
            </p><br>
            <h3>Trains!?</h3><br>
            <p>Yes, trains!</p><br>
            <p>I've been thinking about this for some time. I know it seems like a ridiculous reach, but give me a chance. At first, it seems like it could be coincidence...</p>
            <p>However, I believe Professor Sycamore has a connection to trains, both in a literal sense (he rides them) and in a thematic sense. Let me explain! Throughout the player character's journey in Kalos, they will encounter him repeatedly in train-related locations, such as the monorail station in Coumarine City, the railway hub of Couriway Town, and the bustling Lumiose Station. On the surface, these meetings seem coincidental or practical. Kalos, with its European-inspired urbanity, relies on trains.</p>
            <p>However! A critical detail is that Professor Sycamore possesses <mark>HM02 Fly</mark>. He's the person who gives the machine to the player, also implying that he has access to a Pokémon that can use it. In a world where he can just fly wherever he wants, he consistently uses the slower rail transportation. This is a deliberate preference, I think, because Professor Sycamore's character definitely revolves around savoring the experience of journeys.</p><br>
            <p>While not necessarily canon, in <i>Pokémon Masters EX</i>, the trainer's lodge offers a variety of topics that the player character can choose to speak to Professor Sycamore about. One of those topics is the Subway Bosses, who operate the Battle Subway in Unova. This helps illustrate an interest in rail transportation that's more than immediate practical use. It implies an appreciation, or maybe just an interest, in train culture, especially interesting given he's one of the few professors who participates in battles!</p><br>
            <p>After the player character enters the Hall of Fame, it's Professor Sycamore himself who gives the player the TMV Pass. He doesn't just hand it over; he enthusiastically says:</p>
            <div class="quote-sycamore">
                <strong>Professor Sycamore, Lumiose Station:</strong>
                "... So the reason I asked you to come here is... I wanted to give you a pass to Kiloude City! Doesn't ring any bells? Kiloude City is a city in the southern part of the Kalos region. And it's the perfect place for Trainers looking to sharpen their skills! So here's your pass for the super high-speed rail to Kiloude City! Use it to ride the TMV super high-speed rail! Take your pass to that scanner over there. It's an orange machine. Have the machine scan your pass to board the train. Have a fantastic time!"
            </div>
            <p>He's so enthusiastic! For reference, here's the item description of the TMV Pass:</p>
            
                <mark>A commuter pass that allows the holder to ride the TMV between Lumiose City and Kiloude City at any time.</mark>
            </div>
            <p>He repeats over and over about the <mark>super high-speed rail!</mark> and hands over the pass while giving detailed instructions on how to use it. His knowledge of how the scanning process works and which machine to use suggests he's very familiar with the system, likely through personal use.</p><br>
            <p>Looking at the TMV Pass itself again, it's described as a <i>commuter pass</i>. The idea that Professor Sycamore has access to passes like this and gives the player one implies he might be a regular user of this route, too. Kiloude City, in-game, is described as a "kind, sweet, and exquisite city" that "exemplifies southern Kalos life"... which sounds like exactly the kind of place that Sycamore would like!</p>
            <p>In Dendemille Town, Sycamore mentions:</p>
            <div class="quote-sycamore">
                <strong>Professor Sycamore, Dendemille Town:</strong>
                "How's your journey going? You see, when I was younger, I visited many different regions as well. I met many kinds of Pokémon and noticed how each place has its own distinct flavors. So, I really came to enjoy trying new foods as I traveled. Because of my adventures, I'm an expert on the cafés all over Kalos."
            </div>
            <p>His journeys, exploration, and culinary appreciation definitely align with somebody who would use trains for discovery and not just for convenience. Could you imagine him enjoying a scenic train ride? Meeting and talking to people on the train? Trains are, after all, a kind of social space as well!</p>
            <h3>Couriway Town</h3>
            <p>Couriway Town is an important place to Professor Sycamore, isn't it? I personally feel that his relationship with trains is very significant in Couriway Town. Couriway, in-game, is described as a "town of connecting differences," and its map description adds: <i>The railway brings people from great distances to see the huge, majestic falls.</i> This description is literal: this town is a major railway junction that links Kalos with many places. But the description can also be interpreted metaphorically: this is a space where diverse elements come together to enjoy something memorable (in this case, Couriway's landmark is the waterfalls). It's in Couriway that Professor Sycamore chose to hide his <i>treasure</i>, his treasure being a personal letter to his future self.</p><br>
            <div class="quote-sycamore">
                <strong>Professor Sycamore's Secret Treasure:</strong>
                "To the person reading this: What are you like now? Did you become who you wanted to become? For starters, what was the person you wanted to become even like? I don't know, but it would be wonderful if you could boast that you're living each day to its fullest. To future Sycamore. From the Sycamore dreaming of the future."
            </div>
            <p>Why did he choose this place specifically? I don't think it's an accident. Train stations are liminal spaces. They represent transitions, about moving from one place to another, one identity to another. They are places where you pause between departure and arrival, between past and future.</p>
            <p>For someone like Professor Sycamore, who seems to be grappling with questions about identity and purpose (I mean, that letter is pretty heavy, isn't it?), a train station represents possibility. It's a place where change happens, where journeys begin.</p><br>
            <h3>Let's Consider Mega Evolution!</h3>
            <p>Professor Sycamore is the mega evolution researcher, but he can't actually achieve it himself. The games mention that he tried training at the Tower of Mastery but left early because he <i>felt he didn't have what it takes</i>. Think about what mega evolution represents: transformation, overcoming limitations, becoming something more than what you were before. Kind of like trains in a way, movement from one place to another, a transformation through journey. Trains represent connection and infrastructure, too. They follow predetermined paths, they have systems and schedules, and they bring distant places together. For someone like Professor Sycamore, who dedicates his life to understanding connections—between trainers and their Pokémon, between evolution and mega evolution, between regions and research—trains kind of represent this systematic, purposeful way of bringing things together. Additionally, think of Couriway in particular: this sophisticated piece of human technology brings people from all over the world together to see a natural phenomenon (the waterfalls). Science, nature, and the bond between them joining up to create a lasting moment, a memory for you to cherish.</p><br>
            <h3>Arriving at a Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Of course, this is all speculative! Maybe Professor Sycamore just happens to be at train stations because that's where the game developers needed him to be for ease. But something about Professor Sycamore and trains feels intentional. Game design can be thoughtful about these details, especially in XY, which has so many themes about connection and relationships. What I adore the most is how trains fit with Professor Sycamore's advice throughout the games. He is always saying, <i>treasure your journey, it's about the time spent with people along the way</i>, etc... it's very much a traveler's mindset, a traveler he has admitted to being! It's not about getting to the destination ASAP, but enjoying the ride. I don't really know how to end this, but I think there is something lovely about the idea of Professor Sycamore finding joy in train travel, in the quiet moments between destinations where he can exist, socialize, and see the world.</p>
