    These are bite-sized, web-based visual novels I've made. They feature
    Professor Sycamore as a character you interact with. Please enjoy! I hope to
    make more of these featuring different perspectives.</p>

      ><strong>A Beautiful Meeting!?</strong></a
    >
    - You are Lysandre, technological genius and visionary. You meet with your
    friend Professor Sycamore over coffee, unsure how long it's been since
    you've last truly had a heart-to-heart with him. </P>
   <P>This is a short visual novel made in
    <a href="https://communistsister.itch.io/videotome-adv">Videotome:ADV</a>!
    I've tested it on chromium and firefox based browsers, so it should work!
    Please CTRL+F5 if something isn't loading correctly. There are three
    obtainable endings based on the choices you make! </P>

      ><strong>Professor Sycamore's Office</strong></a
    >
    - You arrive to Professor Sycamore's office when he's not there, giving you
    time to nose around. </P>
       <P> A very short game involving just pointing, clicking, and reading some
    descriptions. It's more of a proof of concept if anything...
  </p>
