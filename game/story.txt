Chapter1
BG_INTRO SFX_TITLE - A Beautiful Meeting!?
SET:intimacy:0 FG_BLANK - The beginning.
    CLEARSCREEN - 
BG_TITLE - You are Lysandre, the ambitious leader of Lysandre Labs. 
STATUS:[✧Status: A Visionary!]] - ... and the owner of the popular Lysandre Café.
Despite your busy schedule overseeing groundbreaking technological innovations and various philanthropic efforts, you've received a message.
BG_SYCCALL - It's from your old friend Professor Augustine Sycamore, asking if you might spare some time to meet.
You've grown somewhat distant in recent months...
Due to certain responsibilities.
There was a time when you were inseparable.
GOTO:cafe - Something in his message suggests he might miss your company...
###
cafe 
BG_OUTSIDE - You briskly make your way through Magenta Plaza, the afternoon sun glinting off the architecture of Lumiose City.
STATUS:[✧Status: Arriving to your café]] - Lysandre Café bustles with its usual afternoon crowd.
SFX_CROW SFXVOL:0.1 - It's a youthful crowd, ranging from the avant-garde artists working on their newest screenplay...
BG_CAFE - to the bogstandard socialites and sychopants.
The smell of ground beans fills the air, mingling with hushed conversations and the gentle clinking of porcelain.
You check your watch for the third time in six minutes.
It's not like you to be so concerned with punctuality when you've already arrived fifteen minutes early.
BG_CAFEINSIDE - Inside...
STATUS:[✧Status: A familiar sanctuary]] - The low lights cast a glow over the stylish interior of your café.
Some patrons glance your way. You, the tech mogul of Kalos, always draw attention.
It's a given.
You're nonchalant about that, though, as you navigate to your seat.
STATUS:[✧Status: Waiting at the Café]] - The server brings your usual espresso to the table.
L! - Merci.
Your café. Your coffee.
Your city.
You adjust your cravat slightly, watching the drink in the cup.
Something feels different about today...
Perhaps it's simply the anticipation of seeing an old friend.
How many years has it been since your last conversation?
A proper one. Two? Three?
Time seems to blur when you're pursuing a vision...
BG_CAFEINSIDE SFX_BING MUS_SYC FG_SYCPRESENTS: S! - Lysandre! Mon ami!
His voice cuts through the café, all too familiar. His baritone is as full-bodied and as warm as the coffee you serve.
L! - Professor.
L! - You arrived exactly on time.
STATUS:[✧Status: Professor Sycamore has arrived]] - The professor hasn't changed much since you've known him.
Coiffed dark hair, always looking windswept.
FG_SYCJOYFUL - That carefree smile.
It carries no burdens, does it?
S! - You sound surprised! 
S! - May I?
He gestures to the empty chair across from you.
CHOICE1:[Of course]:Chapter2 CHOICE2:[I've been waiting]:Chapter3 L! - Ah...
###
Chapter2
MODE:standard SET:tone:polite L! - Of course, Professor. Please join me.
FG_SYCWINK S! - Still so formal, Lysandre?
He slides into the seat casually.
S! - I suppose that's part of your charm!
GOTO:conversation - He offers a wink that most would find disarming.
###
Chapter3
MODE:standard SET:tone:intimate SET:intimacy:intimacy+1 - I've been waiting, Professor.
FG_SYC S! - Oh?
L! - Longer than you'd know.
He slides into the seat with a curious tilt of his head.
S! - I'm sorry, Lysandre. I didn't mean to keep you waiting!
GOTO:conversation - His obliviousness to certain matters has always been both endearing and frustrating.
###
conversation
The server approaches instantly, as if summoned by Professor Sycamore's presence.
FG_SYC S! - Un café au lait, s'il vous plaît.
After the server departs, Professor Sycamore leans forward, chin resting on his fingers.
FG_SYCSMILEFOLD S! - So, how is the café business? Lysandre Café is becoming quite the sensation!
L! - A mere side project. A pleasant diversion.
Your fingers trace the rim of your espresso cup.
S! - You've never been one for "mere" diversions.
FG_SYC S! - Everything you involve yourself in has purpose, doesn't it?
STATUS:[✧Status: Discussing business with Sycamore]] - There's a knowing glint in his eye that makes you wonder about how much he's pieced together.
He is more perceptive than many give him credit for.
L! - You know me too well.
L! - And what of you? Still unlocking the mysteries of Mega Evolution?
S! - Among other things! Though lately I've been focused on a bunch of promising young trainers. 
FG_SYCPRESENTS SFX_BING S! - The next generation, if you will!
The phrase catches in your mind. 
The next generation.
Your jaw tightens almost imperceptibly.
L! - And do they show promise? These children?
CHOICE1:[The world needs strong trainers]:Chapter4 CHOICE2:[The future demands excellence]:Chapter5 CHOICE3:[(Lost in thought...)]:confession L! - Professor, 
###
Chapter4
MODE:standard SET:worldview:practical L! - The world needs strong trainers now more than ever.
Your hand clenches slightly around your cup.
FG_SYCSADGE MUS_MAYBE S! - That's what I thought you'd say.
His smile falters, just for a moment.
S! - I suspect we might disagree on what constitutes strength in the end.
L! - Perhaps. Though I've always valued your perspective, Professor.
FG_SYC L! - Even when we disagree.
GOTO:memories - His expression softens at that, eyes crinkling at the corners.
###
Chapter5
MODE:standard SET:worldview:idealistic L! - The future demands excellence. We must preserve what beauty remains in the world. Once lost, it can never be reclaimed.
Your voice drops lower, more intense.
FG_SYCJOYFUL MUS_MAYBE S! - Always the protector!
There's fondness in his tone, but something else too. Concern?
FG_SYC S! - Sometimes I wonder, though. Who decides what beauty is worth preserving?
L! - Those with the vision to see what is truly precious.
L! - And the resolve to protect it.
You find yourself glancing at the disheveled mess that the Professor's hair has found itself in, the wayward locks framing his face in such a way...
L! - Not everything beautiful needs to be changed.
L! - I believe that things that are beautiful should stay that way forever.
GOTO:memories - He catches your gaze.
###
confession
SET:worldview:conflicted SET:intimacy:intimacy+1 - The café seems confined suddenly.
FG_SYC MUS_MAYBE SFX_HUH S! - Lysandre?
L! - Only thinking, Professor. About the potential of these children.
L! - And the responsibility that they may have to utilize the knowledge you give them.
L! - If you knew that one of these children were going to do something... difficult. Something others might not understand.
FG_SYCSRS S! - Something they believed was right?
There's a knowing edge to his voice that startles you.
L! - Yes. 
S! - I would want to understand their reasoning...
S! - I've always believed in listening first. 
S! - Especially to those I care about.
L! - And if that wasn't possible?
FG_SYCSADGE S! - ... I would still value the trust it took to confide in me.
His smile is sad.
STATUS:[✧Status: A crossroads]] - This isn't meant to be shared. Not with him.
L! - Thank you, Professor.
The silence in the air between you.
GOTO:memories - It's the closest you'll come to confession.
###
memories
FG_SYCSMILEFOLD MUS_RETROSPECTIVE S! - Do you remember that summer?
STATUS:[✧Status: Memories resurfacing...]] - His voice softens.
L! - I wouldn't forget that, Professor.
S! - We spent an entire weekend camped out on the beach, all for a glimpse of that supposed "Mega Lapras"!
L! - Of which we never saw.
You share a laugh, the sound of it bringing back a flood of memories. The sand, the conversations, the way his eyes reflected the stars.
His laugh is boisterous enough to draw glances from the other patrons, but you don't mind the attention.
STATUS:[✧Status: Reminiscing...]] - The afternoon sun catches in his dark hair, highlighting strands of premature silver you hadn't noticed before. Something about it makes your throat tighten.
S! - Just the two of us...
FG_SYC S! - Those were simpler times, weren't they?
L! - We were different people then.
You can still remember the smell of the ocean, the way his shoulder pressed against yours as you watched the horizon.
S! - Were we? Sometimes I wonder if we've changed as much as we think.
He reaches across the table, fingers briefly brushing against your hand.
CHECK:tone:intimate:eq:intimatemoment:Chapter7 - The touch lingers...
###
intimatemoment
S! - Speaking of the past, I still have that book you lent me...
He looks sheepish.
L! - The one on megastone deposits off the coast of Ambrette? From three years ago?
FG_SYCJOYFUL S! - That's the one! I've made notes in it. I hope you don't mind!
His eyes meet yours, unexpectedly vulnerable.
S! - Perhaps you could come by the lab sometime? To collect it.
L! - Perhaps I could.
The invitation hangs between you.
S! - It would be nice to show you my recent research as well.
L! - I would like that, Professor.
SET:intimacy:intimacy+1 - Your agreement to make time out of your busy schedule doesn't go unnoticed by the professor.
STATUS:[✧Status: Boundaries shifting...]] - The professional veneer between you cracks... just a bit.
L! - It's been too long since we've properly discussed research.
S! - Yes, well. We've both been busy...
The slight hesitation speaks volumes.
GOTO:Chapter6 - The bond between you deepens.
###
Chapter6
FG_SYC S! - Remember that night?
The café seems to fade into the background.
L! - I remember everything we do together, Professor.
Your voice is steadier than you feel.
S! - I often think about what you said then. About creating a more beautiful world.
L! - I still intend to.
Your eyes meet his, unwavering.
S! - I know. 
FG_SYCSADGE SFX_HUH S! - That's what worries me sometimes.
The concern in his eyes is genuine.
GOTO:departure - His hand returns to his coffee cup. You feel its absence.
###
Chapter7
FG_SYCPRESENTS SFX_BING S! - Your Holo Caster technology is remarkable, by the way!
His enthusiasm is almost childlike in its exuberance.
L! - A necessary innovation for the future I envision.
Your pride in your creation is evident despite your measured tone.
S! - Always looking ahead, aren't you?
L! - Someone must.
Your eyes drift to the window, to the city beyond.
FG_SYCJOYFUL S! - Just don't forget to occasionally look around at what's already here!
GOTO:departure - You find yourself unable to look away.
###
departure
His Holo Caster chimes softly, breaking the moment between you. The real world intrudes once more.
FG_SYC S! - Ah, forgive me. The lab calls.
He glances at the device with visible reluctance.
L! - Of course. Your work is important.
He stands, straightening himself out with an apologetic smile, brushing away invisible creases.
STATUS:[✧Status: Professor Sycamore preparing to leave]] - You rise as well, instinctively.
S! - We shouldn't let so much time pass before our next meeting!
L! - Agreed. Perhaps dinner next time?
FG_SYCWINK S! - I'd like that very much.
He hesitates, then steps closer. The scent of his cologne is strong, now.
CHECK:worldview:idealistic:eq:Chapter8:Chapter9 - The café seems to fade around you for a moment.
###
Chapter8
S! - Lysandre...
STATUS:[✧Status: Heart pounding..]] - His voice carries a weight.
You find that you enjoy the sound of your name on his lips.
FG_SYCSADGE SFX_BING S! - Promise me you'll be careful with whatever you're planning.
L! - You know I calculate every move with precision.
Your smile doesn't quite reach your eyes.
S! - That's not what I meant.
He places a gentle hand on your shoulder, squeezing once.
S! - I care too much to see something happen to you.
GOTO:goodbye - The sincerity in his eyes is almost painful to witness. For a moment, you consider telling him everything.
###
Chapter9
S! - Your passion has always been your most captivating quality.
His voice is soft.
L! - Your optimism has always been yours.
You mean it as a compliment, but...
S! - We balance each other well, don't we?
L! - Indeed. We always have.
Complementary yet opposed.
FG_SYCJOYFUL - His smile turns heartachingly fond.
S! - If only circumstances were different...
GOTO:goodbye - The unfinished thought hangs in the air between you.
###
goodbye
MUS_SYC S! - Until next time!
He leans in, pressing a brief kiss to each of your cheeks in the traditional Kalosian farewell.
Though traditional, there's nothing traditional about the way his lips linger near your ear.
FG_SYCCLOSER S! - Please remember what matters, Lysandre.
A plea, not a command.
SFX_CROW FG_BLANK - And then he's gone, weaving through the tables with graceful steps.
MUS_MAYBE L! - What matters...
STATUS:[✧Status: Alone..]] - You remain standing, watching Professor Sycamore through the window as he disappears into the crowded street.
CLEARSCREEN - Your reflection stares back at you from the window glass.
CHECK:intimacy:2:gte:ChapterPursuit:StandardEnd - The weight of your vision presses down on your shoulders.
###
ChapterPursuit
SET:tone:intimate SET:worldview:conflicted - The beauty of this world. The future. Him.
Your carefully constructed walls falter...
Just for a moment.
L! - Professor...
The title slips from your lips.
BG_OUTSIDE - Before you realize it, you're on your feet, through the door.
The crowds part instinctively before your purposeful stride.
STATUS:[✧Status: A moment of weakness?!]] - Something compels you forward,against your better judgment.
There! a glimpse of that windswept hair turning the corner.
CHOICE1:[Call out]:ChapterReconcile CHOICE2:[Watch him go]:ChapterResolve - Your voice catches in your throat.
###
ChapterReconcile
MUS_NICEEND L! - Augustine!
Your voice carries over the crowd, uncharacteristically urgent.
BG_OUTSIDE FG_SYCSHOCKED - He turns, surprise evident in his widened eyes.
S! - Lysandre?
The distance between you closes.
L! - I think perhaps...
For once, words fail you.
S! - Yes?
There's hope in his voice.
L! - I've been remiss in our friendship. I would like to remedy that.
Your hands clasp behind your back, a rare gesture of uncertainty.
L! - There is a private exhibition at the museum next weekend. Rare artifacts from ancient Kalos.
L! - I have two invitations. Would you accompany me?
It's not your plans you're sharing, but something equally precious...
Your time.
FG_SYCJOYFUL S! - I... yes, of course I would.
His expression softens into something dangerously close to tenderness.
S! - I've missed you, mon ami.
L! - And I you.
A truth amidst your necessary secrets.
STATUS:[✧Status: A tentative bridge]] - Beautiful things can be preserved, after all...
BG_TY CHOICE1:[Start Again]:Chapter1 - The beginning of something new.
###

You watch him disappear into the crowd.
The weight of your vision settles back onto your shoulders, heavier now.
STATUS:[✧Status: Resolve strengthened]] - Some sacrifices must be made for a beautiful world.
Even this one.
L! - Goodbye, Professor.
Your whisper is lost to the bustle of Lumiose City.
BG_LABS MUS_EVILEND - Later, in your laboratory, you stare at the blueprints spread before you.
Your hand hovers over the designs, mind replaying the afternoon's conversation.
For a moment, you see his face reflected in the polished surface of your desk.
L! - A beautiful world requires difficult choices.
L! - Choices that only those with strength can make...
You return to work with renewed determination.
BG_TY CHOICE1:[Start Again]:Chapter1 - The end is inevitable.
###

Perhaps it doesn't matter. 
Some sacrifices must be made for a beautiful world.
