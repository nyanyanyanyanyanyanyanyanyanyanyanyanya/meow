            The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) is one that barely needs an introduction. Originally debuting in the US in 1999, the TCG has released thousands of cards for collectors worldwide to enjoy! Professor Sycamore wasn't introduced into the TCG until February 5, 2015, when the first Pokémon XY TCG set was released! This set, besides debuting Professor Sycamore (he wasn't in earlier generations!), also introduced two major mechanics: Fairy-type Pokémon and Mega Evolution! Let's review all of Professor Sycamore's cards.

              The first three cards share artwork of Professor Sycamore's official art where he's standing in his office, a unique render not seen elsewhere.<br><br>

              The special thing about BREAKPoint is that it’s the first set to give Professor Sycamore an alternate art card! Illustrated by Naoki Saito, this card depicts Professor Sycamore in a new location with one of the Kalos starters, Chespin! He’s enjoying a cup of coffee, looking cute, casual, and effortlessly chic! This is one of my favorite illustrations of him. He shares the same number as his BREAKPoint release, but a small mark by the number indicates it’s an alternate version. I wonder where he is? Maybe another room in his big lab!<br><br>
              Each of his cards has the same effect: discard your hand and draw 7 cards. I don’t play the TCG much, so I can’t say if he’s a strong card, but I’d like to think so! His supporter role reflects his role in the games, which makes sense. Professor Sycamore got another card in Steam Siege, his first and only full-art card as of 2025.

              He is so cute, I could just cry! This full-art card is adorable and captures everything you need to know about his character! That tricky Chespin is making a mess, and Professor Sycamore will have to clean it up. Clumsy… anyway, Steam Siege came out in 2016, so it’s been a while since Professor Sycamore got a new card. There have been rumors of a leaked card with new art, but who knows what the future holds? I’m excited for new Professor Sycamore cards!

              This is the newest card of Professor Sycamore! Part of the Prismatic Evolution set released in 2025, it shows him standing in front of his laboratory, the Sycamore Pokémon Lab! The lab looks very yellow here, cozy and homey next to Lumiose’s modern buildings. He looks adorable with a soft jawline and clear eyes in this illustration.<br><br>
