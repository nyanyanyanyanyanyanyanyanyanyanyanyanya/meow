      This is a webshrine dedicated to Kalos' very own Pokémon Professor, <b>Augustine Sycamore</b>!  <img src="images/sideviewHD.png" class="right" alt="Side View of Professor Sycamore from his concept Art"></p>
      <p>Professor Sycamore is from the Pokémon XY games, released on Oct. 12th, 2013. Why South Boulevard?
      It's where the Sycamore Pokémon Lab is located in Lumiose City!</p>
      <p> Prof. Sycamore is known for his kind demeanor and passion for Mega Evolution research. He values love,
      connection, and understanding the bonds between people and Pokémon. His openness makes him empathetic,
      and his big heart makes him warm. He can be a bit scatterbrained, but he's sharper than he seems...</p>
